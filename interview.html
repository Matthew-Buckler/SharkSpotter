<h1>The Opinion of a Local Expert - An Interview with Dr. Gavin Hanke</h1>
<img src="images/gavin.jpg" style="width:20%; float:left">


<p>As part of my research, I conducted an Email interview with Dr Gavin Hanke.  Since 2004, Dr Hanke has been a Curator of 
Vertebrate Zoology at the Royal BC Museum, located in Downtown Victoria.</p>


<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>


<p>During my interview I asked Dr. Hanke several questions:</p>


	<p style="margin-left:40px">1: <u>"It’s my understanding that you specialize in the study of marine life, including fish and sharks.  
	Could you please elaborate on your studies of fish, sharks and marine ecosystems?"</u></p>
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He told me that as a scientist, sharks “are of particular interest to him” and that earlier this year, 
		he obtained a 1.2 meter Shortfin Mako for the Royal British Columbia Museum’s collection. As well, he is hopeful that he will obtain a 
		Great White (but he’s got no idea where he’d store it!).</p>


	<p style="margin-left:40px">2: <u>"I’m wondering about your thoughts on the Sharkspotter project.  Is this something that you were 
	aware of prior to me contacting you?"</u></p>
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He had not heard about the “Sharkspotter” project, but found it really interesting.  He owns an 
		electric car and he likes the fact that a emissions-free vehicle could be used to patrol beaches because they’re 
		“far quieter than fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and motor boats and they would be better for wildlife, quieter for 
		beach-goers, and would not produce C02 emissions".</p>  
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He went on to say that local researchers are “using drones to document 
		habitat and archaeological sites” so he really believes that drones are useful tools.</p>

	
	<p style="margin-left:40px">3: <u>"It’s my understanding that there are many endangered shark species that can be hurt by 
	fisheries and things like shark nets.  What are your thoughts there?"</u></p>
		<p style="margin-left:80px">With respect to the use of anti-shark nets, Dr. Hanke believes that they pose a risk to wildlife - and can 
		cause the drowning deaths of non-target species drowning in nets. He provided a local example of how even in freshwater, he has seen 
		nets drown non-targeted species like aquatic birds, mink, beavers and muskrats.</p>  
		<p style="margin-left:80px">From this part of the interview, I learned that these 
		nets are ineffective, costly and  “indiscriminate killers” and their use should be discontinued, especially if there are other methods 
		like the “SharkSpotter”.</p>

	
	<p style="margin-left:40px">4: <u>"I’m wondering about global warming and whether the oceans will warm in B.C. and this may encourage 
	southern shark populations to become more prevalent in BC waters".</u></p>	
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He said he does think climate change will draw southern species northward. He expects Leopard Sharks to show up 
		in BC - they have been seen in Puget Sound - so it is not a huge jump northward. Great Whites are more common here in warmer years - so we 
		can expect them to range northward. The fishes here though may not simply retreat - some may move north - but others likely will find 
		cooler refuge in deeper water, leaving habitat open for southern fishes to range into BC.</p> 
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He says the ultimate effect of climate change may be to increase fish diversity here in BC.</p>
	
	
	<p style="margin-left:40px">5: <u>"I’ve been told that there are a variety of sharks in the waters of B.C., including on 
	occasion, Great White Sharks...is that true?"</u></p>
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He spoke about the 15 types of sharks present in the waters off of BC:</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">1. Bluntnose Sixgill Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">2. Broadnose Sevengill Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">3. Brown Catshark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">4. Pacific Spiny Dogfish</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">5. Pacific Sleeper Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">6. Basking Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">7. Blue Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">8. Tope Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">9. Common Thresher</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">10. Smooth Hammerhead Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">11. Pacific Angel Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">12. Salmon Shark</p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">13. <b>Great White Shark</b></p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">14. Shortfin Mako Shark </p>
			<p style="margin-left:120px">15. Lantern Shark (this is only hypothesized at this time because one hasn’t been caught yet in BC waters)</p>
	
		<p style="margin-left:80px">Yes, the list included the Great White Shark - they have been present intermittently for quite some time</p> 
		<p style="margin-left:80px">If the water warms a degree or two more, (due to Global Warming) he feels that they would move northward more frequently 
		because we have abundant seals and sea lions to support their eating habits.</p>

	
	<p style="margin-left:40px">6: <u>"Given the 2 questions above, Do you think the SharkSpotter drone will ever be needed 
	within British Columbia?"</u></p>
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He told me that shark attacks are still very rare in North America and he sees no reason for netting or aircraft to 
		patrol beaches. Also the water is pretty murky at times, so visibility is limited</p>
		
		<p style="margin-left:80px">However the SharkSpotter drone is a cheap way to patrol beaches with the intention of searching for 
		sharks - it also would be handy as a safety feature to patrol for swimmers in need of help (caught in riptides, injured, tired, hypothermic). 
		
		<p style="margin-left:80px">He said, "some people may complain about the buzzing of a drone, but if it saves a life, it is well worth it.”</p>
